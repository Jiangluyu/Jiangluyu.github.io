### Q1: Smart phone & navigational devices or ask the locals for direction?

**Main idea:** the former

**Reason 1:** professional --> accurate, efficient

**Example 1:** locals maybe do not know or give obsolete information --> slower, while navigational devices are always up-to-date

**Reason 2: **no need to care about language problem

**Example 2:** cannot speak Japanese, Last year travel to Japan, Google Map --> not miss any event planned
